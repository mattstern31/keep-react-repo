## Installation

### Vite React Application

After creating a React application with Vite, follow these steps to
install Keep React:

`Step 1:` Install Tailwind CSS

```
npm i autoprefixer postcss tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

`Step 2:` Install Keep React:

```
npm i keep-react
```

Or with Yarn

```
yarn add keep-react
```

`Step 3:` Go to the `tailwind.config.js` file and paste the
following code:

```
import keepPreset from "keep-react/src/keep-preset.js";
export default {
  content: ["node_modules/keep-react/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  presets: [keepPreset],
}
```

`Step 4:` Add Tailwind CSS to index.css File:

```
@import "keep-react/src/main.min.css";
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Next JS Application

You can easily integrate `keep-react` into your Next.js application. Starting from Next.js version 13.4, the app router automatically installs Tailwind CSS, eliminating the need for a separate Tailwind CSS installation. If you have already installed Tailwind CSS as part of the Next.js application setup, you can proceed with Step 2. Otherwise, start with Step 1.

After creating a Next JS application, follow these steps to
install Keep React:

`Step 1:` Install Tailwind CSS

```
npm i autoprefixer postcss tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

`Step 2:` Install Keep React

```
npm i keep-react
```

Or with yarn

```
yarn add keep-react
```

`Step 3:` Go to the `tailwind.config.js` file and paste the
following code

```
module.exports = {
    content: ["node_modules/keep-react/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
    presets: [require("keep-react/src/keep-preset.js")],
};
```

`Step 4:` Add Tailwind CSS to globals.css File:

```
@import "keep-react/src/main.min.css";
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Keep React. Now you can import any component from keep-react and use it in your project.

## usage

'use client';
import { Button } from "keep-react";
  const App = () => {
