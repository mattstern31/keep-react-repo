## Table of Contents

The Badge component in the Keep React allows you to add visual indicators or labels to highlight specific information or provide additional context. With customizable options for style, size, type, icon, and state, you can create versatile badges that fit your design needs.

## Default Badge

The default badge offers a simple yet effective way to highlight information. It's a versatile component that can be customized to suit various design requirements.

<CodePreview github="Badge" code={DefaultBadgeCode}>
  <DefaultBadge />
</CodePreview>

## Sizes of Badge

The Badge component provides two available sizes: `xs` (extra small) and `sm` (small), allowing you to choose the appropriate size for your specific design needs.

<CodePreview github="Badge" code={SizesOfBadgeCode}>
  <SizesOfBadge />
</CodePreview>

## Variant of Badge

The Badge component offers three variants: `colorType="light"`,`colorType="strong"` and `badgeType="text"`. These variants provide options for different visual styles, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your design and helps highlight the badge content effectively.

<CodePreview github="Badge" code={VariantOfBadgeCode}>
  <VariantOfBadge />
</CodePreview>

## Icon With Badge

The Badge component can be combined with an icon to create an enhanced visual element that conveys additional information or status. You can position the icon on either the `iconPosition="left"` or `iconPosition="right"` side of the badge, allowing you to customize the badge's appearance and ensure its compatibility with your design.

<CodePreview github="Badge" code={IconWithBadgeCode}>
  <IconWithBadge />
</CodePreview>

## Badge With Dot

You can display a badge with a dot by setting the `dot` prop to `true`. Additionally, you can customize the position of the dot by using the `dotPosition` prop, allowing you to choose between `left` and `right`.

<CodePreview github="Badge" code={BadgeWithDotCode}>
  <BadgeWithDot />
</CodePreview>

## Only Icon With Badge

You can utilize the Badge component to create badges with just icons. This is especially useful when you want to display a compact and visually informative badge alongside an icon.

<CodePreview github="Badge" code={OnlyIconOfBadgeCode}>
  <OnlyIconOfBadge />
</CodePreview>
