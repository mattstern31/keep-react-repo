            <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              The main difference is that the core components from Keep Design System are open source under the MIT
              license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that keep Design relies on smaller
              and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              However, we actually recommend using both keep Design, keep Design Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is
              no technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
